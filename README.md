# CrossroadSimulator
### A simulator of a crossroad, where cars can come in from four different directions and YOU get to choose which traffic light to set to green or red and which cars to let through or to stop.
The current version of this application shows a window with four dots, representing the traffic lights, that can be clicked on to change their state from red to green or from green to red.
A red traffic light will let cars pass, a green traffic light will make the cars stop.
The cars are added at random time intervals and are represented by a yellow dot with an ID inside (or close by).
